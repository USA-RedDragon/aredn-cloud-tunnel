# AREDN Virtual Node

[![Release](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/aredn-cloud-tunnel/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/aredn-cloud-tunnel/actions/workflows/release.yaml)

This project is intended to set up a "Cloud Tunnel" for the AREDN network. It acts like a node without any RF link capabilities. The purpose is to allow a large group of users to connect to a tunnel prior to RF deployments being rolled out.

## Warning

It should be noted that in a disaster situation, it's likely that the internet will go out and this tunnel will be of no use.
