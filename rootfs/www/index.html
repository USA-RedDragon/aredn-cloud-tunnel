    <h2>KI5VMF-CLOUD-TUNNEL</h2>
    <p>This project is intended to set up a "Cloud Tunnel" for the AREDN network. It acts like a node without any RF link capabilities. The purpose is to allow a large group of users to connect to a tunnel prior to RF deployments being rolled out. </p>

    <p><span style="color: red">Warning:</span> It should be noted that in a disaster situation, it's likely that the internet will go out and this tunnel will be of no use.</p>
